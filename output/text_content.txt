					with voiceovers and a really easy way to flip your class. Share them on the web, Facebook or Twitter!

					Schedule questions on the fly as you teach, and view student
					performance analysis in real time to tailor your instruction.

				    Want your students to share their work with the rest of the class? 
				    Mirror any iPad or Android tablet's screen to your desktop and then to a projector, 
				    without any cables or wires. Transform your projector into a giant tablet screen for 
				    a truly immersive learning experience. Is your class using Chromebooks or laptops? 
				    Now, they can mirror their screens and present right from their seats to your

					so your entire class can participate  either individually or in small groups. 
					You can project each student's work on the screen and even annotate over them.
Flipped Classroom
Create clips by annotating over your notebooks and recording voiceovers. You can also embed videos from YouTube or Khan Academy and upload your own videos. Add assessments at different points in your clips to check student understanding. Focus class time on interacting with students and providing personal guidance. You'll also save time by not having to repeat a lecture or spend extra time with students who missed a lecture.

					And students can respond using any web enabled device like
					laptops, tablets, or smartphones.
Cloud Based
Annotate stores all content and student performance data safely and securely on the cloud so you never have to worry about losing your work.

Annotate.net Adds Support for Google Cast Screen Mirroring
Enables wireless desktop mirroring from Chromebooks, PCs and Macs in addition to iOS and Android screen mirroring.
Attleboro, MA, Oct 20, 2014
- Simpliphi, Inc. today announced the addition of Google Cast screen mirroring to the list of supported features in the Annotate Mirror Client. With this update, Annotate.net becomes the first and only software to support native screen mirroring from iOS, Android, Chromebooks, PCs, and Macs wirelessly through software, without requiring cables or any extra hardware whatsoever.
After the launch of Annotate.net last month with inbuilt support for screen mirroring from iOS and Android devices, several teachers requested support for screen mirroring from Chromebooks, to enable students to present and share their work. The latest version of Annotate Mirror Client, released earlier today, allows students to present from their seats by simply mirroring their Chromebook's screen to their teacher's computer and onwards to a classroom display.
With the increased adoption of Chromebooks and Android tablets in schools and colleges, Annotate.net will allow schools and districts that have invested in Chromebooks to leverage their existing investment in classroom technology by getting access to premium features that were previously exclusive to iOS based solutions only.
Annotate.net gives extreme flexibility to school districts where the technology roadmap for 1:1 implementation is still evolving. Districts that originally started off with iPad implementations, but migrated to Chromebooks can protect their investment with a solution that is guaranteed to run seamlessly across multiple platforms. Annotate.net works equally well in iOS installations or Android + Chromebook installations, or alternately in BYOD classrooms comprising a mixture of devices.
Annotate.net is a comprehensive cloud based software for improving teacher mobility and student engagement in the classroom. It integrates a mobile interactive whiteboard, screen mirroring, real time student response systems, remote desktop control, and student collaboration tools in a single lightweight solution.
Pricing
Annotate is free to sign-up. Teachers at schools or colleges can sign up for an educational license with extra features. Premium features are on promotion with a 50% discount.
About Simpliphi Inc.
Simpliphi Inc, an education startup, created Annotate to enable teachers to use tablets and existing classroom technology to improve student engagement. For more information, please visit

Annotate.net allows teachers
completely untethered
instruction and assessment
Combines Chromecast & Airplay screen mirroring, a mobile interactive whiteboard, and 
				formative assessments in a unified cloud based solution.
Attleboro, MA, Sep 16, 2014
- Simpliphi Inc. announces today the launch of
Annotate
(
http://www.annotate.net
), a new cloud service that allows instructors to be completely mobile 
				in the classroom and effectively engage students. Using their tablets, instructors can now teach 
				completely untethered, conduct formative assessments in real time, and mirror their screens 
				onto their projectors or smart boards for truly immersive learning experiences.
Successfully field tested within schools in New York City, Annotate runs on all HTML5 compliant 
					browsers like Safari, Chrome, and IE on desktops as well as popular tablets running iOS,
					Android, Windows RT, and Fire OS. Screen mirroring and interactive whiteboard require a small 
					client to be downloaded on a user's Windows or Mac computer.
Chromecast and Airplay Screen Mirroring to a PC or Mac
With the rapid growth of iPads and Android tablets in classrooms, teachers have been looking 
					for novel ways to leverage them for instruction. Annotate is perhaps the
only
solution that 
					allows screen mirroring and recording from both Android tablets and iPads to a PC or Mac.
Mobile Interactive Whiteboard
Shrinking school and college budgets have left little money to invest in expensive hardware like 
					interactive whiteboards. Annotate enables teachers to use virtually any tablet as an interactive 
					whiteboard, annotate over content, and control PowerPoint or Keynote remotely while being 
					completely mobile in the classroom.
Real time Student Response System for Formative Assessments
Increased focus on student performance has put pressure on instructors to be more effective in 
					the classroom. Annotate saves precious class time by allowing instructors to conduct formative 
					assessments directly from their instruction slides. It supports data driven instruction by 
					collating student responses in real time, enabling teachers to tailor instruction on the fly. 
					Students can respond using web enabled devices or via text messaging from basic cell phones.
Pricing
Annotate is free to sign-up. Teachers at schools or colleges can sign up for an educational 
					license with extra features. Premium features are on promotion at 50% off.
About Simpliphi Inc.
Simpliphi Inc, an education startup, created Annotate to enable teachers to use just a tablet 
					and existing classroom technology to engage their students. For more information, please visit

Privacy Policy
Updated as of: September 3, 2021 (prior versions are available
here
)
Simpliphi, Inc. (the “
Company
”, “
we
” or “
us
”) 
                    is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. We are committed to protecting student privacy and are a proud signatory to the
Student Privacy Pledge 2020
.
The following Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through the annotate.net website and our software made available through the website (collectively, the “
Service
”). By providing Personal Information to us, you acknowledge receipt of this Privacy Policy.
Our relationship is governed by the Annotate.net
Terms of Use
, and may further be governed by separate additional terms with your school or school district (our customer, where applicable).
PLEASE SEE SECTION 6 (CHILDREN; COPPA) FOR SPECIAL TERMS REGARDING OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER AGE 13.
As a high-level, general overview:
The Service is designed to help instructors use a range of learning tools with a closed group of their students, and to help instructors share their instructional content with their students and with others.
We limit the information we collect or maintain, how we use it, and who we share it with, to what is needed for this educational purpose.
Our business model is simple – we charge users or their institution a fee for use of the Service. We are not in the business of selling information to third-parties, or of marketing or advertising for third-parties.
We apply protections for
students under age 13
to address COPPA requirements, but almost all protections that we apply to child students we also extend to teen and adult students.
We seek to comply with U.S. privacy laws, and include information below about how we comply with
COPPA
,
FERPA
,
SOPIPA
,
CIPA
. If you are concerned about a specific legal requirement that we have not addressed in this Privacy Policy, please let us know. The Service is currently only offered in English and is primarily intended for use in the U.S.
Our full Privacy Policy is below, after the table of contents.
Please contact us if you have any questions.

1.
WHAT IS ANNOTATE.NET?
The Service is intended for use by instructors, such as K-12 teachers, professors, corporate trainers or other presenters (“
Instructors
”), who wish to use the Service to use a range of tools with students or participants in their course or program (“
Students
”), or wish to share instructional materials with Students or others, or find and access instructional materials shared by others.
Examples of tools include digital white board tools, quiz and polling tools, screen sharing, streaming and recording tools, content annotation and management tools, and discussion and collaboration tools.
Tools are used within the group of registered users consisting of the Instructor and the Students admitted by the Instructor (“
Course Members Group
”). The Course Members Group is managed by the Instructor.
Instructors must be at least 18 years old, and can be an Educator Instructor or Non-Educator Instructor (as detailed in section 1.3 of the Terms of Use
here
). Students may be (a) “
Child Students
” (under age 13), or (b) “
Older Students
”, which includes “
Teen Students
” (ages 13-17) and “
Adult Students
” (at least 18 years old). A school may also have “
Administrative Users
” who manage the Service for the school. Parents or guardians of Students are not intended users of the Service.
2.
SCOPE OF THIS POLICY
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect through the Service.
The section titled
“Children; COPPA”
describes how our information policies differ for Child Students.
If you access the Service through your School or School District’s subscription to the Service, then your School or School District may impose additional requirements on us or on you, such as requirements to comply with the School’s privacy policy or its Parents’ Bill of Rights, or additional requirements imposed by your local or state government.
Individuals may separately follow us on, or share information through, third-party social media platforms. This Privacy Policy does not cover activities on those other platforms.
3.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
3.1.
Personal Information We Collect
As described in more detail below, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information from Instructors, as well as from Students.
“
Personal Information
” is information that identifies an individual, including the following categories:
Name
Email address
Photograph
Voice recordings
Video recordings
Student ID or registration ID
If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us in connection with the Service, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We intend to only collect Personal Information that is directly related to our delivery or improvement of the Service.
We do not request, collect, or use geolocation data, health data, biometric or genetic data, sensitive data (such as relating to racial, ethnic, political opinion, philosophical or religious belief, criminal background, trade-union membership, or sexual orientation), or data regarding participation in free or reduced lunch programs.
We ask that you not send us, and not disclose on or through the Service, any such information.
We do not request, collect, or use behavioral data for any sort of advertising or marketing purpose, or for any purpose disallowed by COPPA or FERPA.
We do automatically collect usage data in the ordinary course of operations, as discussed under
“Other Information”
.
Any Other Information, including non-personal or technical information, that is combined or linked to Personal Information of the types listed above, is Personal Information for purposes of this Policy.
We do request age (year and month) information, and school affiliation, and treat that information as Personal Information when we combine it with Personal Information.
We do not control, and cannot monitor, all information users choose to include in user-created content. We expect that almost no user-created content will be of a nature that, on its own, identifies an individual. We treat user-created content as Personal Information when we combine it with Personal Information, or when required by applicable law. (See
“Other Information”
)
3.2.
How We May Collect Personal Information
Except as otherwise described below with respect to Child Students, we may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through the Service:
We may collect Personal Information through the Service, such as when you create an account or upload or submit information, or when you or an Instructor uses voice or video recording features or screen sharing type features.
From Integrated Services:
If you decide to register for the Service through, or to otherwise grant access to, a third-party social networking or integrated service that we may make available (each, an 
                                “
Integrated Service
”), such as Facebook Connect or Google, we may obtain your name, email, and gender information from the Integrated Service. You may revoke our access at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the relevant Integrated Service.
From Other Sources:
We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as public databases or other third-parties.
3.3.
How We May Use Personal Information
We limit use of Personal Information to the following (and further limit its use with respect to Child Students as described under
Child Students; COPPA
):
To provide the Service.
To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you newsletters.
To send administrative information to you, such as information regarding the Service and changes to our terms, conditions and policies.
To send to Instructors marketing communications about the Service that we believe may be of interest. You can unsubscribe to marketing communications as described below (see
Advertising and Marketing - Unsubscribing
). To be clear, we do not advertise or market to Students.
For our internal operations business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying the Service, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.
3.4.
How Personal Information May Be Disclosed
The Service includes access controls to restrict unauthorized access to Personal Information. We do not sell or rent Personal Information, and do not share it with third-parties for advertising or marketing purposes. We do not disclose Personal Information for research purposes. Except as further limited below with respect to Child Students, Personal Information may be disclosed for the purposes of delivering and improving the Service, in the event of a merger or acquisition, or as mandated by law, as follows:
For all Users:
To our third-party service providers who provide services supporting the internal operations of the Service, in each case to the limited extent necessary, and subject to assurances about protection and use. (For more details
see Third Party Services
.)
To third-parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings) (an “
Acquisition
”). Such third-parties may include, for example, an acquiring entity and its advisors. We will notify you if an Acquisition is completed where a successor company will receive your information. This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your data transferred in an Acquisition, and may be changed only in accordance with its terms (
see Changes to this Privacy Policy
).
If you access the Service through your School or School District’s subscription to the Service, then your School or School District may have Administrative Users who can exercise a range of administrative and oversight activities on behalf of your School or School District, including potentially the ability to access account information; access, disclose or restrict information that you provided through that subscription; and otherwise manage accounts under the School or School District’s subscription, including changing user types, terminating account access, or accepting or acknowledging changes to our terms.
If you are a Student:
To your Instructor. Your Instructor will also have access about your submissions and other activity through the Service, including, for example, notebook annotations, responses to quizzes or polls, written assignments, written discussion entries, audio captured (for example in class discussions or annotation clips), and information submitted through screen sharing features.
To your Course Members Groups. For example, submissions made through the announcements, projects, or screen sharing type features are visible to both your Instructor and other Students in your Course Members Groups, possibly along with your name and photo.
If you are an Older Student or an Instructor:
By you if you generate a URL Link to specific content that you created, and (a) you instruct us to send the link by email to specific individuals whose email addresses you provide, or (b) you copy and share the link outside of the Service. (This URL Link sharing feature is not available to Child Students). Information you share publicly may be available to other users and the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to share any information outside the Service.
If you are an Older Student, by your Instructor, for example if your Instructor includes information or recordings within materials for another course or shared in their public profile or outside the Service.
If you are an Instructor:
By you, if you share publicly, for example on your public profile page, or through other services to which you are able to post information and materials. (Students do not have public profiles, and do not have access to integrated features for sharing through social media). Information you share publicly may be available to other users and the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to share any information outside the Service.
If you are a Non-Educator Instructor using a Free Account
For Instructors that are Non-Educator Instructors and are using a free-account, their Notebooks and Clips default to being publicly available for others to view and use (see
Terms of Use – Section 4.2.c Notebook or Clip Designated as Public vs. private – Free Accounts of Non-Educator Instructor
). If you do not wish to use the Service to share educational materials with others outside your course, you can upgrade to a paid account.
Compelled Disclosure
We may also use or disclose Personal Information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; and (e) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others.
If we are compelled by a government request or subpoena to disclose Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you or your school, to the extent permitted by law and by our contract with your school (our customer) where applicable.
Disclosure by Others
We cannot guarantee how other users may use or share your information.
4.
OTHER INFORMATION
4.1.
Other Information We May Collect
“
Other Information
” is any information that does not, on its own, identify an individual, such as:
Browser and device information
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
Demographic information and other information provided by you or your Instructor (such as birth year and month, and school affiliation, assessment responses, information you submit or store in the Service as user-created content or through course participation)
Aggregated information
4.2.
How We May Collect Other Information
We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through your browser or device:
Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that the Service functions properly.
Using cookies:
Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your device. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Service, pages visited, language preferences and other traffic data. We and our service providers use the information only to support the internal operations of the Service, such as for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Service and to recognize your device to assist your use of the Service. We also gather statistical information about use of the Service in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how it is used and assist us with resolving questions regarding it.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to
http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html
. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Service. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log-in every time you visit.
We do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals at this time.
Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:
Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with the Service to, among other things, track the actions of users (including in connection with the emails we send), measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about use of the Service and response rates.
Analytics:
We use third-parties, including Google Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Service and report on activities and trends, however we configure applicable settings to disable marketing and advertising features. For example, in Google Analytics, we disable “Data Collection for Advertising Features” to turn off “remarketing” and “advertising reporting features”. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
.
IP Address:
Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet service provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Service, along with the time of the visit and the pages visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for the purposes of providing support for the internal operations of the Service, such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Service. We may also derive your approximate general location from your IP address.
From you:
Information such as your communications preference may be collected, assessment responses, user-created content, or class participation.
By aggregating information:
Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Service.
4.3.
How We May Use and Disclose Other Information
We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except that (a) if we are required by applicable law to treat Other Information as Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, (b) where we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, and (c) we do not use user-created content for any purpose other than as specifically licensed to us based on the type of user account (see
Terms of Use - “Content, Notebooks, Clips, Licenses & Options”
).
5.
CHOICES AND ACCESS
5.1.
Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information
In addition to the fact that Company already configures Google Analytics settings to disable data collection for advertising, all users can choose for their usage to not be tracked by Google Analytics by installing Google’s browser add-on (see
“How We May Collect Other Information – Analytics”
).
For Students, we have already limited our use and disclosure of Personal Information to what is necessary for the purposes of providing the Service to you and your school, and in the event of an Acquisition or legal mandate. For Child Students, we make no other disclosure. For Older Students, any other disclosure is at your sole choice and control by generating and sharing a URL Link.
If you are an Instructor, you may opt out from receiving marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis by clicking the unsubscribe link in any such email. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out.
If you are an Education Instructor, or a Non-Education Instructor with a paid account, you can control what Instructor-created content is visible on your profile page.
If you are not an Education Instructor, and you are using the free version of the Service, you can upgrade to a paid version in order to manage sharing your Instructor-created content on your profile page.
5.2.
How you can access, change, export or suppress your Personal Information
5.2.1. User Profile Information
For Personal Information in a user’s profile, if you are registered using an email, you may update, correct or delete that Personal Information through your account settings page. If you, or your child, is not registered using an email, you can make a request through your school, or contact us as described below in this section 5.2. Account profile data is very limited, and can be exported by printing your account profile page.
5.2.2. User-Created Content
If a user includes Personal Information within user-created content, you can access, change or delete that information by deleting or editing that content through the Service, except where the content has been submitted to the Instructor for grading, it can only be modified with Instructor’s permission.
As between Annotate and you, you own any user-created content submitted by you. For details about the licenses granted to Annotate and to other users of the Service, please see the
Terms of Use [Section 4 “Content, Notebooks, Clips, Licenses & Options”]
. In particular, note that for Non-Educator Instructors using free accounts, their user-created content is displayed with their profile page and licensed for public sharing and reuse.
You can export or download your user-created content, generally as a PDF file. A premium account may be required to download in a different file format.
5.2.3. Student Assessment Data.
For Student assessment data combined with Personal Information of an identifiable Student, that data can be exported or downloaded by the applicable Instructor.
5.2.4. Process to Review, Delete, Terminate.
Authorized representatives of any K-12 school are permitted to review Personal Information held on their behalf, in order to verify accuracy, and to request its correction, update, or deletion.
If you are an Instructor or authorized school administrator and would like to review the Personal Information we have collected from your Student, or if you would like to ask us to make no further use of, correct, or delete, the Personal Information we have collected from your Student, please contact us using
this form
.
If you are a parent or Student, please contact us through your school (our customer) to request review, correction or deletion of information, or termination of an account. If the Student’s access to the Service is not through a school (for example for Teen Students or Adult Students using the Service outside the K-12 context), or if you cannot contact us through your school, please use
this form
to make such requests.
In your request, please include your name and the Student’s name, and specify the action you would like us to take. For the Student’s protection, we may need to verify your identity and relationship before implementing your request.
5.2.5. Deletion of Information.
Personal Information will not be retained longer than it is reasonably required to provide the Service and will be deleted promptly when it is no longer reasonably required or upon request, whichever is earlier, subject to any contractual obligations to the school (our customer) if applicable. Company generally intends to maintain Personal Information for a period after a Student last accessed the Service, to enable Students to return to earlier course work for later reference, however we make no guarantee that user information will be retained. Information may be permanently lost if a school, instructor or user terminates a course or an account.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion. There may also be residual information that will
temporarily
remain within our databases and other records
in back-up systems which will be over-written in the ordinary course, generally within 30 – 60 days
. It may not be reasonably possible to locate or delete recordings of screen shares, or a given individual’s voice or image from recordings of class discussions,
however, such information will also be deleted when it is no longer necessary to deliver the Services for the school.
6.
CHILDREN; COPPA
6.1.
Children and COPPA Generally
As a service designed for use by Instructors in schools, including elementary and middle schools, we are especially sensitive to protect Child Students and their Personal Information.
This section describes how we treat Child Students differently from what is described above for Older Students, and is intended to also explain how we address the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“
COPPA
”), including requirements for parental consent and our commitment to parents’ ongoing rights regarding their child’s Personal Information.
The definitions of Personal Information and Other Information above applies also to Child Students (as defined above), except that for Child Students we may additionally collect information about the child’s parents (such as name and contact information).
Regardless of whether information is received from Child Students, or from their Instructor, we work diligently to protect that information.
Except as described below, we use and disclose the Personal Information of Child Students as set forth above, under “How We May Use Personal Information” and “How Personal Information May Be Disclosed.”
The rest of this section describes how our information practices are different with respect to Child Students.
6.2.
Parental Consent.
COPPA requires that an operator of an online service not collect Personal Information from a child without the prior consent of their parent, which consent can be obtained directly from the parent or through the child’s school or school district.
We have implemented the Service so that a course code is required for all Students to self-register for the Service or to enroll in a course. Child Students must have a course code granted to an Education Instructor in a school context. We obtain contractual assurances that the school or school district has agreed to our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with COPPA. We do not use the COPPA exception that allows for collecting personal information from a child for the sole purpose of seeking parental consent, because we rely on the school or school district to obtain parental consent.
Parental consent, as obtained through the school or school district, is limited to collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information required for delivery of the Service (i.e. for sharing with Instructor/school and classmates, and for “internal operations”), or in the event of an Acquisition, or as compelled by law, in each case subject to the restrictions described above in
“How Personal Information May Be Disclosed”
. Parental consent does not permit any other disclosure to third-parties.
Parental consent can be withdrawn at any time, and Personal Information can be deleted, as described in
section 5 of this Policy
.
6.3.
Required Information.
To use the Service, an account is required (other than for view-only access to a link-URL shared by the owner of user-created content). For a Student to use the Service, an Instructor can set up an account for a Student with only a first and last name, and when the Student first logs in they will be asked for birth month and year. If the Student sets up their own account, then the following information is required: a first and last name, birth month and year, email address, and a course code provided by the Instructor.
Students do not have public account profiles and their information is not visible outside of their Course Members Groups and authorized school officials except as described for Older Students under section 6.5
“Social Interactions and Content Sharing”
.
6.4.
Limited Use of Information.
As required by COPPA for Child Students, and consistent with our business model for all Students, use of Personal Information of Students is solely for the use and educational purposes of the Instructor or school contracting with us (including through an Education Instructor), and for no other purpose. Our use of Personal Information of Students is limited to that educational or approved program context. Disclosure is also permitted in an Acquisition, or if legally required, in each case subject to the requirements stated in this Privacy Policy (see
“How Personal Information May Be Disclosed”
).
6.5.
Social Interactions and Content Sharing.
Interactions within the Course Members Group are visible to, and can be moderated by, the Instructor. All interactions through the Service are logged.
Child Students cannot use the Service to share their content or interact with individuals outside their Course Members Groups, managed by the course Instructors.
Older Students are generally subject to the same social interaction and content sharing restrictions as Child Students, except that Older Students (and Instructors) may be permitted to share their own user-created content with individuals outside of the Service, for example by creating a URL link to specific content. The linked page includes their name and profile image (which need not be an image of the user). Anyone with the URL Link can view the shared content; only registered users can add comments. The Older Student is responsible for determining what information, and with whom, to share in this way. Sharing outside the Service is not available for Child Students.
6.6.
No In-app Purchases.
In-app purchases are not available to Child Students or Teen Students. In-app purchases to upgrade accounts to access additional features or capacity may be available to Adult Students. Such upgrades are available to Child or Teen Students only through an upgrade by their school.
6.7.
Right to Review, Delete, Terminate.
Upon request from the school (our customer), we will promptly provide a description of the types of Personal Information collected (also included in this Privacy Policy); an opportunity to review the Student’s Personal Information and/or have the information deleted; and the opportunity to prevent further use or online collection of a Student’s Personal Information. For information on the process to review, delete or terminate use of your child or Student’s Personal Information, and for further information about retention and deletion of Personal Information, please see section 5.2
“How you can access, change, export or suppress your Personal Information”
.
7.
FERPA
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“
FERPA
”) protects the privacy of personally identifiable information contained in certain student educational records (“
FERPA Educational Records
”).
The Service is designed to enable schools to comply with FERPA obligations if information stored by the Service is considered FERPA Educational Records. Information stored by the Service would either be submitted by Instructors or school administrators, or result from the use by Instructors and Students of assessment tools within the Service.
To the extent that we hold any FERPA Educational Records, our Terms of Use provide for the applicable school to designate us as a "School Official" (as that term is used in FERPA and its implementing regulations) under the direct control of the school with regard to the use and maintenance of the FERPA Educational Records, and we agree to comply with FERPA’s restrictions on School Officials. Our Terms of Use also support an alternative for FERPA compliance where a school has obtained consent from a parent or eligible student allowing such sharing.
Regarding any information held by us that might constitute FERPA Educational Records, we do not use that information other than to provide the requested services to the school. Nor do we share that information other than to the school’s personnel, at the school’s instruction, or as provided in the Privacy Policy solely for purposes of delivering and improving the Service, in an Acquisition, or as otherwise mandated by FERPA or other applicable law, in each case subject to any restrictions described in this Policy, applicable law, and our contract with the school (our customer). Upon request from the school we will provide confirmation of any disclosures of FERPA Educational Records. Except as otherwise required by FERPA, disclosure to a parent or student should be requested through the school, and would require verification of that person’s identity.
We do not disclose information under the FERPA exception for “Directory” information.
8.
SOPIPA
The Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (“
SOPIPA
”), adopted by certain states, imposes certain restrictions and requirements on vendors of websites, apps, and on-line services directed for use by K-12 schools.
The Service is designed and operated to comply with SOPIPA. Among other things, the Service does not use data from K-12 Students for targeted ads, we do not create advertising profiles for K-12 Students, we do not sell or rent information of K-12 Students, we use K-12 Student information solely for their school’s educational purposes, to improve the Service, or as required by law, and we will delete information upon request as described in section 5.2
“How you can access, change, export or suppress your Personal Information”
.
9.
SAFE INTERNET USE; CIPA
9.1.
CIPA.
The Service is designed to support schools to comply with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (“CIPA”), and to manage safety of minors using internet tools, including by limiting search settings (see below), restricting social interactions (see above), and enabling monitoring and moderating by Instructors (see above).
9.2.
Age appropriateness of content or linked content.
Where the Service includes links or embedded widgets to third-party search tools (such a Google, YouTube, or Flick’r), the linked search is configured to filter out adult content.
Where Instructors or Students create content or include links or embedded widgets within their shared content, they are prohibited by our Terms of Use from including inappropriate content (see
Terms of Use – Rules for Online Conduct
). We will promptly remove content or links that violate those prohibitions upon learning of such violations, subject to reasonable review and notice if appropriate, and, where appropriate, may terminate users accounts. Please
contact us
immediately if you see any content or behavior that is inappropriate.
10.
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
10.1.
Students.
We do not advertise or market to Students.
10.2.
Instructors.
We do not advertise or market third-party products or services to Instructors through the Service or using user email or other Personal Information.
We do promote information about the Service to Instructors through our e-newsletter, through the Service, or using user emails, unless the Instructor unsubscribes as described below.
10.3.
Ad Tracking.
We do not use third-party advertising services, or ad tracking services or technologies, to display targeted advertising on third-party websites or services. We do not permit any third-party to use student data to create an automated profile, engage in data enhancement, conduct social advertising, or target advertising to students, parents, teachers or schools.
10.4.
Unsubscribing.
You may opt-out of receiving our e-newsletters at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" or “manage my email preferences” links located at the bottom of newsletters, or by visiting
this page
to send a request using our online form.
11.
THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
11.1.
Third-party Services Supporting Internal Operations.
We use a limited number of third-party service providers, solely to support the internal operations of the Service, including for roles such as website hosting, data transfer, file conversion, search, data analytics, information technology and related infrastructure provision, software development, customer service, email delivery, auditing and other services.
The categories of information that may be shared with service providers are limited to what is necessary, and are dependent on the specific services they are providing. In general, we do not disclose Personal Information from a user’s account profile to service providers, and for nearly all service providers, we are able to significantly limit Personal Information that a service-provider might have access to.
As a requirement for us sharing student Personal Information with a service provider, we require assurances that the service provider will collect, use, and share that information only in ways that are consistent with our commitments in this Privacy Policy. Among other things, we evaluate the service provider’s ability to safeguard Personal Information, and require assurances that Personal Information of our users will be used and disclosed only on our behalf, and that service provider maintains reasonable data security practices. We do not allow service-providers to re-identify, augment, or combine our end-user’s data with other data sources.
A list of our service providers, and links to their terms of service or privacy policies, is available
here
.
11.2.
Third-party Authentication.
The Service does enable login using third-party authentication integrations, for example to allow a user to log in to the Service using their email or social media account. The information we receive from login provides the name, profile picture, and email address (if available) provided by these services.
If you use your email, social media, or federated login account to login to the Service, that third-party service will know that you have logged in to our Service. However, we do not share Personal Information with those authentication providers.
11.3.
Services Accessed Through Links or Widgets
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third-parties, including any third-party operating any site or service to which the Service links.
For example, this may be in the form of a link or embedded widget, including within content posted by another user.
This may also be true in using image search or video search or embedding tools made available through the Service, which use clearly branded third-party services such as Google, Bing, Flick’r, or YouTube. While the Service does not share Personal Information with those services, it is possible that those services will capture browser or device information, or other information depending on the user’s settings and how they use those services.
Links to the terms of service or privacy policies for services included by Company are available
here
. Other terms may apply to services accessed through links or widgets included in content posted by other users.
Where a user visits another site or service, the terms of use and privacy policies of that site or service apply, and not ours.
12.
SECURITY
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect the security and integrity of Personal Information within our organization.
Among other things, we use TLS 1.2 security at the network level to secure data in transit, including account information, streaming data, and notebook/clip content. All content (notebooks and clips, including any uploaded content) is encrypted at rest. All passwords are salted and hashed. Internally, only authorized personnel have access to Personal Information you provide to us and each employee with access to Personal Information is obligated to maintain its integrity and confidentiality.
Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “
Contacting Us
” section below.
In the event of a security breach, we will use reasonable measures to notify the affected account holders (which may be through their school or district), and will notify relevant authorities, in each case to the extent required by applicable law or our agreement with the school or district.
13.
CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER
The Service is controlled and operated by us from the United States and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and, by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information. If we are compelled by a government request or subpoena to disclose Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you or your school, to the extent permitted by law and by our contract with your school (our customer) where applicable.
14.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may change this Privacy Policy. The “
Updated as of
” legend at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Prior versions are available
here
. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, including changes to the context in which data is collected, we will provide at least 30 days’ prior written notice. Notice will be provided by email to the account holder email associated with the account, if applicable, and by displaying a prominent banner alerting users to the upcoming change, so that you have sufficient time to evaluate the change. Account holder can choose to opt-out by stopping use of the Service before the change takes effect. If you continue to use the Service after you receive notice of changes to this Privacy Policy and after the effective date of the changes, you accept these changes. For accounts held by a school, this choice will be made by a school representative.
15.
CONTACTING US; REPORTING ABUSE
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you identify any content or behavior that violates the Terms of Use or is otherwise inappropriate or abusive, please contact us using

We are a team of experienced educators and entrepreneurs who have been associated with education technology in the United States for almost all our working careers. We are really excited about mobile technology and the transformation it could bring in schools and colleges across the world.
We created Annotate with a very compelling idea - allowing teachers to leverage just a tablet and existing classroom technology to engage their class, every day. Our hope is that Annotate can be an effective tool for teachers and students to explore new ways to create, share, discuss, and learn.
We are headquartered in Attleboro, MA.

Account Types, Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms
8.1

8.2
A valid credit card is required for paying accounts. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number.
8.3
Fees will be charged to your credit card in accordance with the account type selected. We offer a short period to change your mind and request a refund as described at
http://annotate.net/refund-policy
. After that there will be no refunds or credits for partial periods of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for periods unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
8.4
All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) income taxes.

Any upgrade in plan level shall commence a new 12-month subscription. Your credit card will be charged at the time of upgrade for a full twelve-months but will be adjusted to subtract the fees already paid through a prior subscription for any overlapping periods with such prior subscription. For example, if a User subscribes for a twelve-month period starting January 1, and then upgrades to a higher tier plan as of July 1, then the July 1 payment shall be for the full year at the higher rate, minus the fees already paid for the six months from July 1 to December 31.
8.6

How can Annotate enable instruction during emergency school closures?
We are happy to support educators during these difficult times. Daily live-streaming, screen sharing, and audio conferencing limit for Starter (free) student accounts has been increased to 2 hours until June 30, 2021.
Learning does not have to stop when school is closed. Annotate has several tools and features to support instruction when students are not able to attend school. Here are a few ways in which you can use Annotate for remote learning/ digital learning/ e-learning days:
1. Start Livestreaming
With Livestream, you can stream content (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, or SMART Notebooks) from your account directly to student devices. Use the annotation tools to annotate content just as you do on a whiteboard or interactive display. We also support audio streaming through your computer’s mic and your students will be able to hear you on their devices as you speak. Students are also able to make a private voice call to speak with the instructor or ask a question privately using the raise hand feature. If you enable notetaking, students are able to annotate directly on notebook pages during Livestream and you can review their work and provide personalized feedback and comments in real time.
2. Use Screen Sharing in conjunction with the
Web Annotations extension
The Screen Sharing feature lets you get outside the walls of Annotate and stream a browser tab, an application, or your entire computer’s screen to student devices.  Use the
Web Annotations extension for Google Chrome
to use the same annotation tools that are available in a notebook to annotate web pages and highlight text content. You can also take screen captures and insert images directly into your notebook.
3. Remote sessions are as interactive as a real classroom
Embed 10 different assessment types, including fill in in the blanks and short answer, directly in your notebook to keep your students engaged and check for student understanding during your Livestream. Pass control to students so that they can annotate a slide and share their understanding with the rest of the class. Or use the collaboration feature to allow up to 5 students to interact and collaborate together in a small group.
4. Record your lessons for students to watch later
Record a Livestream or Screen sharing session for review by students later. You can also create clips from your existing notebooks by recording your annotations with voiceovers. You are able to embed assessments at specific points within a clip to test for student understanding. You can also embed videos from YouTube and Khan Academy or upload videos from your computer or mobile device.
5. Publish content directly to student accounts, share privately, or to Google Classroom.
Publish notebooks and clips to your courses in Annotate for self-paced review by enrolled students. All published content is available to students from their accounts. If students do not have accounts, you can share content privately by sharing a private link through email. If your school uses Google Classroom, you are also able to share notebooks and clips directly to Google Classroom.

Annotation Clips
What are Annotation Clips?
Annotation clips are video recordings of your slides, transitions, and annotations with a live voiceover 
					from your webcam and/ or microphone. They are extremely
lightweight
and can be streamed even on 
					low bandwidth internet connections.
What are some benefits of clips?
Clips are a really easy way to flip your class and use class time for one-on-one instruction, 
					give students the opportunity to ask questions, or start discussions. Your students can now review your lectures at their 
					own pace and replay it as often as they would like. It is also a great way for students to catch up on 
					missed lectures.
How do I create a clip?
Open any notebook and tap Record (the last tool on your control toolbar) to bring up the recording 
					panel. If you are using a PC or Mac, you will also be able to record a
voice over
and/ or a
live video feed
from your webcam.
Can I share my clips?
Clips can be published to courses just like notebooks. You can also share clips on the web, on popular 
					social media websites like
Facebook
and
Twitter
, or
embed
them in your blog or webpage.
Can students also create clips?
Yes, students can also create clips that they can present in class. They can also share their 
					clips on social media.
How can students present their clips?
Students use the "
Present
" option on their clip to request presentation on an instructor's screen. Once 
					an instructor approves a student's presentation request, the clip is played either on the instructor's 
					device or/ and on the Annotate Mirror Client connected to a projector or class room display.
Does one need a paid Instructor or student account to create clips?
No, anyone with a registered account can create Annotation Clips. Clips created in free accounts are 
					publicly visible.
Can I also embed assessment questions in my clips?
Not yet, but we are actively working on it.

Virtual Wi-Fi Access Point
Why do I need this?
Network security settings on most school networks and public wi-fi networks at hotels and conferences are the primary 
				reason for screen mirroring not working. 
				By setting up a Virtual Wi-Fi access point, you can enjoy screen mirroring even on restricted school or public networks.
When should I use it?
If your tablet and desktop or laptop are connected to the same wi-fi network or LAN but your tablet is unable to 
				discover the Annotate Mirror Client as a valid mirroring stream receiver, it is most likely to be a network security 
				setting interfering with the discovery. Setting up a virtual wi-fi access point can help enable screen mirroring on such networks.
How do I set up a Virtual Wi-Fi access point?
Login to the Annotate Mirror Client, then open the Settings dialog box, and navigate to the Virtual Wi-Fi Access Point tab. 
				Click "Start my Virtual Wi-Fi Adapter" to initialize the service and then "Enable Access Point" to start the Virtual Wi-Fi access point. 
				Connect your tablet to the Virtual Wi-Fi access point to enable screen mirroring and remote desktop.
Do I need an Internet Connection?
Yes, an internet connection is required on your laptop for the Annotate Mirror Client to download necessary codecs and authenticate 
				your account privileges. You can connect to the internet using either the school or hotel's wifi connection, a separate wired LAN connection, 
				a 3G USB dongle, or through another mobile hotspot.
Can I connect multiple devices to the Virtual Wi-Fi Access point?
Yes, you should be able to connect several devices to the Virtual Wi-Fi access point.
Will my tablet or other devices be able to access intenet through the Virtual Wi-Fi Access point?
Yes, internet access will be shared across all the devices that are connected to the Virtual Wi-Fi Access Point.
How can I know if my laptop support Virtual Wi-fi Access Point?
Open the Settings dialog box on the Annotate Mirror Client and navigate to the Virtual Wi-Fi Access Point tab. 
				Under "Virtual Wi-Fi Settings", if the field "Is my computer supported" says "Yes", your computer supports this feature.
What are the system requirements?
Virtual Wi-Fi is currently supported only on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. Your laptop's Wi-Fi card must support wireless adapter 
				virtualization to access this feature.

Beautiful Fonts @ 10x
What is the "Beautiful Fonts @ 10x" experience?
We are thrilled to introduce fast, super sharp, and crystal clear font rendering even at full 10x magnification. 
				See your documents rendering crisply and clearly just like a retina display and enjoy zooming and navigating through content.
What document formats are supported?
Starting today, we are introducing support for Microsoft Word documents also. Simply import any Word, PowerPoint, 
				or Adobe PDF document and see it render crisply as you zoom in. Import textbook pages, student work, or exercise worksheets, 
				annotate over them, and use them in your Whiteboard or Livestream sessions.
Can I also show a magnified view on my projector/ classroom display?
Yes, starting with v3.73, the Annotate Mirror Client will match the zoom and offset of your tablet's screen during projection and Livestream, 
				with the same level of super sharp font rendering. Enjoy blowing up content on your projector or classroom display and have your students stay focused.
Will my earlier documents automatically be upgraded to render beautiful fonts?
This feature is only supported for notebooks imported into the system after 9-Feb. 
				If you would like any of your older documents to render in sharp fonts, we recommend that you import them again.
Do I need to upgrade the Annotate Mirror Client?
Yes, please update the Annotate Mirror Client to v3.73 or later for projecting notebooks imported after 9-Feb. 
				Earlier versions of the Annotate Mirror Client will continue to render notebooks imported prior to 9-Feb.
Will the v 3.73 Annotate Mirror Client be able to render my older notebooks?
Yes, v3.73 of the Annotate Mirror Client will be able to render notebooks imported prior to 9-Feb and/ or later. 
				Earlier versions of the Annotate Mirror Client will continue to render notebooks imported prior to 9-Feb.
When should I use the "Import as image" option?
While the new notebook import process has been tested extensively, there is a small chance that some 
				notebook page may not render exactly as they do in their native applications. The "Import as image" option is recommended for 
				those situations where better fidelity is preferred over crisper rendering.
